title: 'Book Search Quiz: Using Pounce and UofM Databases'
---
## For this quiz, each question will ask you if a material is availabe. You will use the advanced search in Pounce/Pounce+ as well as the UofM campus databases to find the material and respond with: "Sorry, we don't have that!", "It looks like they have that at another campus", or "Yes, we have that!". If the requested material is a physical copy that is held at Briggs, also think of where it would be and how you would guide them to it.
